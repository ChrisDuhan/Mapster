## Description of Sprint

Pretty much solely focuses on working with the maps branch team on getting location  
working perfectly on the map. Setup location subscriptions for each user to track  
their location in real-time and focused on styling and getting user profile images  
to display properly on the map.  

Had to fix a few database issues where people working from older versions of our  
development branch were still uploading old data that was conflicting with the  
operation of the app.

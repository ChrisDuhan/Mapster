## Description of Sprint

I spent talot of my time studying up on what was implemented when my computer was none functioning last week b/c of my operating
system.  After switching to mint, the adb error I was experiencing with Ubuntu was resolved. I worked with carlos on adding user profile photos to the markers and getting correct styling for the user photo.

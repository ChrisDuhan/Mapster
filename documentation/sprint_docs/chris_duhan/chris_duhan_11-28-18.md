## Description of Sprint

This document details progress from 12pm, November 25, to 12pm November 29.

We worked on displaying the users in a searchable list, and prepared functions for the implementation of friend requests. 
While the user can now search for their friends via a search bar we're having trouble implementing case insensitive searches, and apparently Firestore isn't very good about that.

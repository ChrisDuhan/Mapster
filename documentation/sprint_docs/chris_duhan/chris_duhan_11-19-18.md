## Description of Sprint

This document details progress up until 12pm, November 19.

After a brief brainstorming session to plan the outline of the our database, we began to create the interfaces using the plan as a guide. I later went back and commented those interfaces so that all team members could be on the same page about what info thy need to pass around. A few days later we worked of getting our registration and login system working and making skeleton pages for them. Once that was done I began working on the required documentations that were expected of us. Since then work has been sporadic in nature, comprising mostly of troubleshooting with other sub-teams and trying specific things that strike our fancy but do not take much time.

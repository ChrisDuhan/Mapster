## Description of Sprint

This document details progress from 12pm, November 19, to 12pm November 25.

We implemented the location saving for each user, saving their most recent location for easy reference and adding it to a history of their locations as well. Also began implementing the camera services, with the intent to expand it to both upload images from the devices' gallery and a picture taken at the time of upload.

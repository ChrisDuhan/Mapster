## Description of Sprint
Vasudev and I set up our project and began working on the camera portion. We ran into several 
errors with both xcode and building in ionic. We spent several days trying to fix the building bug,
and Shady helped us figure it out. After fixing the bug we got the camera's basic functionalities to work. 
The camera does not work as intended yet, but will be finished in the next sprint. I commited mine and Vasudev's code
to the camera branch of the main repo.

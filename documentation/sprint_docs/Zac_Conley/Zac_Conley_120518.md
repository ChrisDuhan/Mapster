## Description of Sprint
Brice assigned Vasudev and I to fix a crash on the ios version of the app that happens when you get to 
the map page. We fixed it by running it using the workspace file and updating the podfiles. We then fixed
an error with the camera button crashing on ios by adding a permission to the permission list in xcode.

## Description of Sprint

I spent a little time trying to figure out a way to get the app running on my ios since I kept
having trouble getting the app running on my laptop. I figured I would just get it going on my device
and test all changes via my device that way I wouldn't be having problems linking my own firebase etc.
But I didn't have a mac and I found out that Mackey had it on his device so I went back trying to get it on my laptop.
After some time I finally got it up and running on my laptop linked to the firebase and everything.

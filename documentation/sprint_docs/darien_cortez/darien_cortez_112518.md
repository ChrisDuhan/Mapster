## Description of Sprint


I was having problems pushing anything to github so I spent some time trying to push my sprint docs over and Brice found
that I made the stupid mistake of not accepting his request of being a collaborator. Yeah.. stupid, I know. I kept having problems
getting runtime errors and this entire time because of that Brice was stuck doing alot of the uiux styling and what not. I pulled
Brice aside and told him I felt bad because I felt I was not contributing enough because I can't get the app showing on my laptop, so I met with him to fix the errors.

## Description of Sprint
Brice assigned Zac and I to fix a crash on the ios version of the app that happens when you get to 
the map page. We narrowed it down to a problem with the api keys, but were unable to figure it out in
this sprint. We will try to get it done in the next sprint. We know it is something to do with google maps
running on ios.

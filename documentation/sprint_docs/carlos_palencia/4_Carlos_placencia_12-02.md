## Description of Sprint

Buddy and I worked on adding an HTMLInfoWindow when a marker in the map was clicked. We spend time trying to display the data appropriately
(User's: Full_Name, Active_Time, Profile_Picture) but in the end we realized that it was useless to display the user's profile picture twice.
One in the map as the icon and the other one inside the info window, So we decided to get rid of the HTMLInfoWindow.

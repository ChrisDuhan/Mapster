## Description of Sprint

I spent majority of the time trying to get the app to run on the android device. The problem was with the way the build.gradle and the app file were
formatted. I then had to learn how to load a map the Ionic Native maps. I had get a a specific API key if I wanted the map to display on an android/ios
device. Once I was able to get the app to load on my phone Buddy and I spent some time coding together over VS Share.

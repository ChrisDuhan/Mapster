## Description of Sprint

I spent alot of time working on getting my laptop to work with the main code. 
I had to reinstall my operating system after bricking my system, and reinstall all the frameworks associated with the project. 
Carlos and I worked over VS Share ultimately b/c I still am having issues with my local copy. We worked on using the native
Maps/Geolocation for the project.
